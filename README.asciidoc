** does not support refactoring yet
- by the current file name (without extension) anywhere in the project
- by regex (supporting regex groups, defined in Settings) - https://github.com/krasa/EditorGroups/issues/5[#5] https://github.com/krasa/EditorGroups/issues/21[#21]
- by folder
- bookmarks
            
=== Shortcuts                    
- `Ctrl + Alt + Q` - Refresh

- `Middle Button` - remove from group (only for Favorites)
 
=== Advanced actions and settings
- right click on the panel
- `File | Settings | Other Settings | Editor Groups`
   

== Manually Defined Group Syntax

- `@group.id myUniqueId` - must be unique across the project, creates a new group if there is more than one (otherwise path+index is used, which breaks references on refactoring)
- `@group.root ../../` - root directory, by default the current file's one; accepts macros, relative and absolute paths
                  

=== Relative paths to the current file
- `@group.related file.txt`
- `@group.related ../file.txt`

=== Absolute paths
- `@group.related C:/file.txt`
- `@group.related /file.txt`

=== Macros
- `@group.related MODULE/src/file.txt`
- `@group.related PROJECT/myModule/src/file.txt`

=== Wildcards
- `@group.related ./*`
- `@group.related *.txt`
- `@group.related file.*`
- `@group.related f??e.txt`
- `@group.related fileName` (with all extensions, unless the file exists)

=== Exact filename anywhere in the project
- `@group.related */foo/file.txt`

=== All files with the same name anywhere in the project
- `@group.related \*/foo/file.*`
                 
=== Tab/Title customization
- `@group.title yourTitle`
- `@group.color yellow` (a name from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)  
- `@group.color yellow+3` (or yellow+++ or yellow-3 or yellow--- for darker or brighter shade)
- `@group.color #FF0096`
- `@group.color 0xFF0096`

=== Other
- `@group.disable` (disables indexing of the current file)

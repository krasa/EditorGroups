=== Types of groups
- favorites
- manually defined in `*.egroups` file (with language support) or in any other file 
** does not support refactoring yet
- by the current file name (without extension) anywhere in the project
- by regex (supporting regex groups, defined in settings) - https://github.com/krasa/EditorGroups/issues/5[#5]
- by folder
- bookmarks
            
=== Shortcuts                    
- `Ctrl + Alt + Q` - Refresh                                                           
- `Ctrl + Alt + W` - Switch Group popup                                                         
- `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + W` - Switch File popup

- `Ctrl + Mouse Wheel` or `Ctrl + ; or '`  - switch file (closing the previous one)           
- `Ctrl + Alt + Mouse Wheel` or `Ctrl + Alt + ; or '` - switch file (leaving the previous one opened)
- `Ctrl + Shift + Mouse Wheel` - switch file into a new window                                              
           
=== Tab click modifiers
- `Ctrl + Left Button` - open a file in a new tab
- `Shift + Left Button` - open a file in a new window   
- `Alt + Left Button` - open a file in a vertical split window
- `Alt + Shift + Left Button` - open a file in a horizontal split window
- `Middle Button` - remove from group (only for Favorites)
 
=== Advanced actions and settings
- right click on the panel
- `File | Settings | Other Settings | Editor Groups`
   

== Manually Defined Group Syntax

- `@group.id myUniqueId` - must be unique across the project, creates a new group if there is more than one (otherwise path+index is used, which breaks references on refactoring)
- `@group.root ../../` - root directory, by default the current file's one; accepts macros, relative and absolute paths
                  

=== Relative paths to the current file
- `@group.related file.txt`
- `@group.related ../file.txt`

=== Absolute paths
- `@group.related C:/file.txt`
- `@group.related /file.txt`

=== Macros
- `@group.related MODULE/src/file.txt`
- `@group.related PROJECT/myModule/src/file.txt`

=== Wildcards
- `@group.related ./*`
- `@group.related *.txt`
- `@group.related file.*`
- `@group.related f??e.txt`
- `@group.related fileName` (with all extensions, unless the file exists)

=== Exact filename anywhere in the project
- `@group.related */foo/file.txt`

=== All files with the same name anywhere in the project
- `@group.related \*/foo/file.*`
                 
=== Tab/Title customization
- `@group.title yourTitle`
- `@group.color yellow` (a name from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)  
- `@group.color yellow+3` (or yellow+++ or yellow-3 or yellow--- for darker or brighter shade)
- `@group.color #FF0096`
- `@group.color 0xFF0096`

=== Other
- `@group.disable` (disables indexing of the current file)
